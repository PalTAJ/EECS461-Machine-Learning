Traditionally when we are faced with the task of determining whether a given maze has a path or
not we resort to various search or path finding algorithms which are able to answer this question
with absolute certainty. In this assignment, however, we will take a different approach to solve this
problem by building a classifier that determines (to a certain degree) whether a given maze has a
path or not.
